##Big Data Analytics
Gathering useful insights from the Dataset using interactive tool Apache Zeppelin. This tool provides an integrated platform to have a Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala etc. I am running zeppelin locally on docker by following these instructions. I pulled all the JSON files into HDFS for easy access.
